    <h1>This is the header on my first webpage!</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
    This is the start of my first paragraph. <br/>I am brand new to HTML so I
    decided to look up a couple crash-course style videos. <br/>One of the most
    enjoyable and consumable ones I found was
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk">this</a> one on youtube.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
        Since I don't know much HTML I just used a couple of things a fellow classmate showed me<br/>
        in combination with the tags in this video (h1, hr, p, a, and br) to create the page you're viewing!<br/>
        Hopefully I find a better way to do paragraphs than manually hard-coding in br tags soon. As I understand it <br/>
        the br tag (or break) is used to move text to the next line. It is self closing.<br/>
        The p tag create a paragraph, of which I have two in this page.<br/>
        The h1 (and other h#) tags are for different header text.<br/>
        a (anchor) tag is used to create an anchor. In my case I used a link (href) to link to this page from my <a href="index.html">main page!</a>
