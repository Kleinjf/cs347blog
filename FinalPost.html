            If I were trying to teach this course I would have more teaching
            through live demonstrations. Its no secret that most students don't
            do the readings and when they do, its not assured that they will
            be following along live either. Because of this, I would say
            having smaller projects that maybe don't even do anything but
            allow the student to create their own skeleton of a project would
            be beneficial. Then you could have the homework assignment to be
            to use the skeleton they created in class to make something personal
            and creative.

            The things that helped me the most in the course is seeing a working
            version and being able to mess with it. Unfortunately, for a new
            javascript coder nothing seemed consistent or logical with previous
            languages. This made even the basics very confusing and I would often
            get hung up. Seeing someone else do it meant that I could get my code
            working and not get left behind from the rest of the class while
            also being able to go back later and change things and understand what
            does and doesn't work.
