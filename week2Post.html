        <p>    
            I watched another video on the basics of web development!
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEN5RaKOlA">this</a>
            one on youtube.
        </p>

        <p>
            This video summarized and briefly touched on many topics of web development.
            Namely, how the ineternet exists, how an individual webpage is made, and how
            an individual person can make their own webpage. I'm not sure how in-depth
            these posts are supposed to be, so I'm going to do a brief summary of the points
            that stood out to me.
        </p>
        <p>
            The video started off by explained the difference between front end,
            things the user can see and interact with, and backend, the stuff that allows
            the front end to appear as it does. In order to make a website, one would need
            an IDE (integrated developement environment) to edit the files that make up your
            webpage.

        <p>
            She continued to explain that webpage files are made up of primarily three languages.
            HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am using both HTML and CSS to write this page right now!
            Javascript is something I have not learned yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, she highlighted the basics of hot git works as version control for your
            files. I find it fascinating that I am taking a class at a university where I am
            following an almost identical learning path that someone would recommend to
            anyone on the internet. It really makes me feel as though I am learning practical
            information! I can't wait to write more pages. Good bye for now!
