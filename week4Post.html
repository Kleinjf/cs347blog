    <h1>Jacob Klein's Week 4 Blog Post</h1>

        <p>
            This week I watched a video on some of the challenges of web development, specifically front end!
            Click this link <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuWowKXsNHg">here</a> to watch it yourself.
            In this video the man, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g">Cl√©ment Mihailescu</a>
            identifies 4 of what he considers to be the primary things that make front end development as difficult
            as it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. You must know a lot of different languages as a front end developed.<br>
            Langauges such as Javascript, CSS, HTML. You must also know at least one front-end framework, such as react.
            When combining learning new things and the constant updates to things like frameworks, unlearning old syntax
            and relearning new syntax can be quite difficult.

        </p>
        <p>
            2. Most products and services are going to have at least one part of their UI that is complex.<br>
            Complex UIs are more prone to bugs, spahgetti code, and lag. This can be especially troublesome when the
            complex parts of UIs need to look especially good and run well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Most user interfaces are going to be interacting with some sort of backend or API.<br>
            This means theyre going to send some sort of request asyncronously to the backend and wait for a response.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. The difference between a good UI and a great UI or a great UI and an excellent UI is a disproportionate
            amount of work.<br>
            This means that as you put more work into a website you often get diminishing returns. For example, a lot
            of things have movement on them on pages. I.e. colors changing, animations, or drop downs. This can take a
            lot of time and introduce a lot of bugs. With how easy it is to forget to handle all errors elegantly for
            each thing you add, its not hard to see how the better a website gets, the greater the work grows expoentatially.
